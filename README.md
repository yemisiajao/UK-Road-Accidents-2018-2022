# Visualisation of Road Traffic Accidents: Exploring the Relationship with Population Density in the UK
Road Traffic Accidents (RTAs) pose significant challenges to public safety and requires comprehensive analysis to identify patterns and trends.

This Tableau story aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of RTAs, focusing on various factors influencing accident frequency and severity.

By examining data from multiple perspectives, including temporal petterns, geographic distribution, demographic trends, and road infrastructure, we seek to identify critical insights that can infrm strategies to enhance road safety. 

Key areas of analysis include:
1. Temporal Trends: How accident frequency and severity vary across different years(2018-2022), months, days of the week, and times of the day.

2. Geographic Hotspots: Identification of locations with the highest number of accidents, highlighting regional hotspots.

3. Demographic Insights: Analysis of casualty demographics to uncover trends related to age and gender.

4. Road Infrastructure Imppact: The influence of road types junction details and pedestrian facilities on accident occurrence. 

5. Urban-Rural Divide: Comparing accident patterns between urban and rural areas to understand the impact of environment on road safety..

The analysis presented in this story will uncover understanding that can lead to improved road safety measures and reduced accident rates.
